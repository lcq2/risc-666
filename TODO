# TODO

Project goal: emulate as much as possible latest DooM versions, ideally from DooM to Hexen, possibly Final Doom.

Roughtly in the order I'm going to do it:
- better input handling
- TEST TEST TEST
- cleanup and polish rv_av_* APIs, used to interact with host audio/video
- TEST TEST TEST
- audio and music
- TEST TEST TEST
- scaled hires graphics
- TEST TEST TEST
- add support for compressed RISC-V instructions
- TEST TEST TEST
- add support for floating point (not strictly needed for old-school DooM, but it's better to have it)
- TEST TEST TEST
- switch from newlib to musl (this will essentially drop multiplatform support, I'll need to work on a translation layer)
- TEST TEST TEST
- merge with more modern ports (e.g. PrBoom and similar) or doomclassic as released in Doom3-BFG
- TEST TEST TEST
- add support for Hexen and Heretic, they're too good to be left out
- TEST TEST TEST
- JIT, either through LLVM or manual
- TEST TEST TEST

Yeah, there's a lot fo testing to be done...especially with full versions...
